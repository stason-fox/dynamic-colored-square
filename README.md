# dynamic-colored-square
#### Description: Square that changes color based on mouse and keyboard events. Tools used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I designed the square to change color as follows:<br/>Blue when the mouse hovers over the square<br/>
Red when the mouse button is held down over the square<br/>Yellow when the mouse button is let go over the square<br/>
Green when the mouse is double-clicked in the square<br/>Orange when the mouse scroll is used in the window<br/><br/>I also designed
it to change to the specified color when the first letter of the color's name is pressed on the keyboard (typing "r" on the
keyboard for "red", for example).
